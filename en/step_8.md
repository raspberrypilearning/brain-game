## Challenge: Sound and music
Can you add sound effects and music to your game? For example:

+ Playing a sound when the player gets an answer right or wrong;
+ Adding a ticking sound to your countdown timer;
+ Playing a sound when the time is up;

```blocks
	play drum (10 v) for (0.1) beats
```

+ You could also constantly play background music on a loop.
